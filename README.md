# Concise
### Deep Learning is nothing but Large Neural networks
### Size(Model) ∝ Size(Data) ∝ Complexity(Problem)
# Techniques
### Feature Learning
### [Transfer Learning](https://medium.com/nanonets/nanonets-how-to-use-deep-learning-when-you-have-limited-data-f68c0b512cab)
If Deep Learning is the holy grail and data is the gate keeper, transfer learning is the key.
### Ensemble Learning
